## 🎯 Introduction
Integrated Platform Environment is the one stop solution for a Platform Engineer.
AI agents are deployed to IPE to perform a 4 quadrant resolution covering elimination, efficiency, correlation and automation.
Open AI powered Chatbot to provide all assistance and query resolution required for the engineer and combining other AI capabilities makes the Integration an effective solution for the platform.

## 💡 Inspiration
The inspiration for creating this project comes from the growing need for a unified, efficient, and automated workspace for platform engineers. Managing multiple tools for incident handling, automation, monitoring, and reporting often leads to siloed workflows, inefficiencies, and slower response times.

Problem We’re Solving
Platform engineers juggle between incident management systems, automation tools, monitoring dashboards, and cloud infrastructure,
Our Solution: A One-Roof Integrated Platform
ServiceNow for Incident Management – Centralized ticketing system.

AI Agents & RPA for Auto-Resolution – Reducing manual workload.

Telemetry Dashboards – Real-time insights for quick decision-making.

Cloud-Based, Scalable Infrastructure – Hosted on GCP for flexibility.

## ⚙️ What It Does
>>It Provides the Integrated Platform Environment UI for the platform Engineer.
>>AI Agent to analyse the Incident Tickets and resolve the tickets.
>>It provides the chatbot to contextually chat with OpenAI.
>>Ability to leverage multiple SRE tool for platform troubleshooting.
